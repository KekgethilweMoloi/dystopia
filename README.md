# dystopia

Dystopia is an attempt at a landing page / guide to different dystopian societies.
This guide is not to be taken as factual as most of the information contained here 
is sourced from memories of different anime, manga and random wattpad (machine translated) novels.

This guide was also created with the help of lessons from The Odin Project.

# Inner monologue

My second attempt at a landing-page (hopefully this goes better than the first).
Trying not to cry when it doesn't look exactly how I envisioned it.
I know perfection is not the goal but understanding is. If you any ideas how I can improve-
I'm all ears. 

Was fun though. 10/10 would do code again.
